## CSS Zen Garden - Typography version: A demonstration of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design. 

CSS Zen Garden is a demonstration of the variety of styles that can be achieved through purely CSS. Each participant starts with the same set of files, with a rule the HTML cannot be altered.

- Responsive breakpoints display elegantly on every size device
- Very few nested selecters
- Code variables
