# CSS Zen Garden - Typography version: A demonstration of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design

CSS Zen Garden is a demonstration of the variety of styles that can be achieved through purely CSS. Each participant starts with the same set of files, with a rule the HTML cannot be altered.  

I decided to create a design focused heavily on typography and readability.
- Responsive breakpoints display elegantly on every size device in both landscape and portrait
- Text adjusts meaningfully based on screen size
- Incorporation of BEM methodology
